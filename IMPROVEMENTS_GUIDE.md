# 🎯 Weather Categories Improvements - Visual Guide

## What's New?

### 🔬 **1. Scientifically Grounded Thresholds**

#### Before:
```
Generic labels with vague criteria
- "Very Hot" - no clear definition
- "Very Cold" - unclear threshold
```

#### After:
```
✅ Very Hot: >90°F daily max (NOAA Heat Index Guidelines)
✅ Very Cold: <32°F daily min (NOAA Freeze Warning)
✅ Very Windy: >25 mph max gust (NWS Wind Advisory)
✅ Very Wet: >0.5" precipitation (NOAA Heavy Rain)
✅ Very Uncomfortable: Heat+humidity OR wind+rain
```

---

### ℹ️ **2. Definitions Modal**

**New "Definitions" Button** in Summary Card

Click to open comprehensive modal showing:
- Full description of each weather category
- Exact threshold values with scientific basis
- Data sources (NOAA, NASA standards)
- Metric explanations

**Accessibility:**
- Help icon (?) next to "Weather Probabilities"
- Mobile-responsive scrollable content
- Close via button or X icon

---

### 📊 **3. Enhanced Tooltips**

#### Before:
```
Hover shows: 45%
```

#### After:
```
Hover shows:
🔥 Very Hot
45.5%
9 out of 20 years
> 90°F max temp
```

**Implementation:**
- Bar chart tooltips show complete context
- Probability bars display "X of Y years"
- Threshold shown below category name
- Animated hover effects

---

### 📈 **4. Trend Over Time Chart**

**New Interactive Line Chart** (2005-2025)

Shows:
- All 5 weather categories plotted over time
- Color-coded lines for each category
- Interactive legend (click to toggle)
- Hover for exact yearly values
- Climate change pattern visualization

**Toggle Button:**
- "Show Chart" / "Hide Chart"
- Preserves space when not needed
- Smooth animations

**Use Cases:**
- Identify warming trends
- See changing precipitation patterns
- Understand climate shift impacts
- Make informed long-term decisions

---

### 🔧 **5. Centralized Configuration**

**New File:** `src/config/weatherThresholds.ts`

```typescript
export const THRESHOLDS = {
  VERY_HOT: 90,              // Change once, updates everywhere!
  VERY_COLD: 32,
  VERY_WINDY: 25,
  VERY_WET: 0.5,
  UNCOMFORTABLE_TEMP: 85,
  UNCOMFORTABLE_HUMIDITY: 70,
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Easy to update
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ✅ Documented with sources
- ✅ Used by backend AND frontend
