## 💡 Example Insights

### Example 1: Phoenix, AZ - July 15

**AI Mode:**
```
Based on 20 years of data for Phoenix, Arizona, there's an 
exceptionally high 78% chance of very hot conditions (≥90°F) 
on July 15, with very uncomfortable conditions at 52%. 
Historical trends show very hot days have increased by 15% 
over the past two decades, signaling intensifying summer heat.

💡 Tip: Schedule outdoor activities before 9 AM or after 
7 PM, carry extra water (1 gallon per person), and identify 
air-conditioned spaces along your route for heat relief.
```

**Template Mode:**
```
Based on 20 years of data for Phoenix, Arizona on July 15, 
there's a 78% chance of very hot conditions. Trends show 
very hot days increasing by 15% over the past 20 years.

💡 Tip: Start outdoor activities early morning, stay 
hydrated, and seek shade during peak hours.
```

### Example 2: Seattle, WA - January 10

**AI Mode:**
```
Historical data for Seattle, Washington reveals a 65% 
likelihood of very wet conditions (≥0.5 inches) on 
January 10, with uncomfortable weather at 38% probability. 
Precipitation patterns have remained stable over the past 
20 years, consistent with typical Pacific Northwest winter 
climate.

💡 Tip: Pack waterproof outer layers, waterproof boots, 
and keep an umbrella accessible. Plan indoor backup 
activities for outdoor events.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "WebGPU not supported"

**Cause**: Your browser doesn't support WebGPU

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ **Use Chrome/Edge**: Switch to Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+
2. ✅ **Update browser**: Ensure you're on the latest version
3. ✅ **Enable WebGPU**: 
   - Chrome: `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`
   - Edge: `edge://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`
4. ✅ **Use template mode**: Works automatically as fallback

### Model loading is slow

**Normal**:
- First load: 30-60 seconds is expected
- Subsequent loads: <1 second (cached)

**If consistently slow**:
1. Check internet connection (first load only)
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Try different network (avoid VPN)

### Insight seems generic

**Solutions**:
1. Click **"Regenerate"** for fresh perspective
2. Verify location data is accurate
3. Check that probabilities are varied (not all 0% or 100%)

### Model won't load

**Solutions**:
1. Check available storage (need ~500MB)
2. Disable browser extensions (especially ad blockers)
3. Try incognito/private mode
4. Clear browser cache
5. Use template mode as fallback

```typescript
// Line ~180
const response = await llm.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [...],
  temperature: 0.7,     // 0.0-1.0: Higher = more creative
  max_tokens: 200,      // Max length of response
